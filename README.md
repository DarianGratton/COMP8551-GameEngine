# COMP8551-GameEngine
Major Project for COMP8551

## Setup
### Make
In order to run make you will need make for windows found here:</br>
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm </br>
Note: Just dl and install complete package

## How To Run (Cygwin)
### Running
Navigate to file that contains Makefile then:</br></br>
To build the game
```
make
```
To run the game
```
./engine.exe
```
### Debugging
If when trying to run it says it can't find glfw3.dll, just move the dll file in libs to the same folder as the Makefile. Again not sure why this is a thing.
